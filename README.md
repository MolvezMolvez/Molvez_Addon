# Molvez_Addon
The first community addon !

Hello everyone! 
Welcome to the first community addon!
Molvez

A UNIQUE addon that needs nothing but itself.
An addon that takes everything into account: UI, collection, quests, details, chat, etc. etc... 
Here you can share your ideas, talk about anything and everything.
My name is Pierre, and I'm pretty good at photo editing and I'm learning LUA Code, so I thought, why not practice on a wow addon. Might as well combine business with pleasure, right? 

So I'm slowly learning, but even if I'm able to define frames graphically, I'm not yet at the level to create such a major addon on my own. 

So I'm defining the addon's graphic approach, and if you'd like to take part in the coding, I'd be delighted to!
